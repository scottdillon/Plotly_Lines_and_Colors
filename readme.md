# Plotly_Lines_and_Colors

### Synopsis
This is a collection of helper constants, plotly.graph_obj classes and other
objects to help keep my code cleaner. There is also included a cheatsheet
for plotly.graph_objs containing an almost full list of commonly (for me)
used Scatter object attributes. I'll work on also adding the Bar class
attributes soon.

### Motivation
Instantiating plotly Scatter and Bar objects with all of the corresponding
attributes, dictionaries, colors and string objects clutters up my code.
Instead, I can instantiate from these pre-set objects to quickly and cleanly
create new Scatter objects and just assign data attributes.

### Installation
Clone the repo.

### Code Example
Getting this working.
